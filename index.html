        <h1>Adam Russcher</h1>
        <p class="divider">
            As an exploratory metal and glasssmith, my jewellery and art pieces are
            rarely planned out ahead of time. My designs evolve during the
            fabricating of the different materials,  forming and shaping  by hand, flame or hammer blows. The modelling can move very quickly, other
            times components wait to be paired together somehow in some balance.
            Its a sculptural process that has to finalize with something
            original and innovative, possibly wearable and attractive. Often
            my pieces resemble some buried treasures dug from the earth, having antique presence of unknown age and origin.

            my collections  for movie props or any custom work or orders. Thanks!</p>

        <p>Adam's early metal smithing interests and development started while
            taking welding and blacksmithing course in Vancouver and Nelson BC .
            He focused on making small metal sculptures and  using copper repousse
            techniques with recycled and scrap metals.  His first jewellery
            classes were with Liz Abbott in Vancouver and  he attended 3D design
            classes at Emily Carr University of Art and Design. In 2005 he
            traveled to Mexico to study with master silversmiths Antonio and
            Enrique Lopez in San Miguel de Allende. In 2006 and 2007 he returned
            to Mexico several times to Study with Billy King at Sterling Quest
            School of Silver Jewellery Design and Creation.  </p>
            <p>Adam also  explores
            working with flame working borosilicate glass and how he can
            incorporate this into his jewellery creations. In 2021 he entered his
            copper and gold 5-in-1 Unknown Earth earrings into the Craft
            Council of BC Earring show winning the Limited Edition category
            amongst a field of international entries.  He has made original
            handcrafted jewellery in Mexico, Brazil, Vancouver and  he currently
            lives and works in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
